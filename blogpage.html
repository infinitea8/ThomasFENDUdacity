            <p>Time to decide to step into this new character. I had spent my first 18 months of sobriety in Atlanta, “trudging the life of happy destiny.” 
              So, I decided to move out of the country. I started off spending a year in Singapore and then the next 3.5 years in Bali, Indonesia. 
              I was loving this new country, a new freedom.

              Was I running? What was I free from? 
              Free from really having a chance to confront those whom I had seriously injured back in the U.S. 
              and also free to pursue my sobriety “ wrapped in a cocoon of love and peace”. 
              As written in the Big Book of AA, “my imagination was fired”, I was rocketed towards a fifth dimension. 
              My passion for fitness in combination with my newfound appreciation and love for the beach inspired me to design and 
              create a multi-functional beach fitness bag that can be filled with sand and water.

          <p>Everything felt like my life was moving in the right direction. I started manufacturing in Bali, through the efforts of an amazing lady. 
            The first 100 units went okay. However, there were some manufacturing challenges. when it was suggested that I go back 
            home to the U.S. and properly sort them out. What? I was flourishing in my Bali surroundings. I had a beautiful Villa and 
            two beautiful dogs. I was working to help others in the community while being surrounded by loving, caring spirits.</p>

            <p>Why leave? For starters, I had just lost my brother to suicide, and secondly, I was missing my parents. 
              So, I decided it may be a good idea to return to the U.S. I purchased a round-trip ticket back home. 
              With zero intention of going to Los Angeles, but intending on gaining proper manufacturing and coming back to Bali.
              You have heard of the expression, we plan and God laughs! Little did I know the universe’s plans for me. 
              Sobriety in Bali had created such a warm, loving atmosphere that I forgot that there was still character-building work to do! 
              Here is another saying. Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth. (Mike Tyson’s response to a reporter’s question)


            </p>
            <p>Imagine my surprise when the only company that would manufacture my bag, was in Los Angeles, CA! This was the last place 
              I wanted to return to. This was the scene of some of my greatest forest fires, in Los Angeles, CA. 
              but, life sent me right back to Los Angeles, CA. I got punched in the mouth. Repeatedly. The shots I was taking shook my foundation. 
              For some reason, I kept pushing my Bali return date back. I hadn’t secured manufacturing. So, I gave myself a deadline. October 23rd, 2015. 
              I am getting on that flight and heading back.
              Boy was I tested! I was homeless in Cali. I didn’t have a circle of friends. Still, my desire to NOT escape 
              the pain was tested more than it had ever been. In the past, it had been easy to numb my life with alcohol, drugs, sex, 
              and anything else that kept my mind off of the pain. But those were not options for me. 
              I knew that there was zero to be gained from going backward. I longed for Bali. My bag production was a tough journey. 
              The cost of production was higher than expected. Then my father died. We laid his body to rest on Oct 21st.

            <p>2 days before I was set to return to Bali, October 23rd. Needless to say, I didn’t leave. I was too shocked, stunned, and adrift. I just lost my pops. What followed was truly a trudging journey for the next 8 years. I was facing the 5-year mark of my sobriety journey. A very important mark. According to many authorities on sobriety, “24 percent of AA members stay sober between one and 5 years”.

              This was the moment I had to dig deep and connect with everything that made my sobriety possible. The fellowship, me helping others, prayer, meditation, listening to and surrounding myself with metaphysical healers, thinkers. Early on, all of these actions helped me to experience moments of clarity and discipline. This practice early on in sobriety, gave me a tremendous solid foundation.
              
              I learned the Steps of sobriety to stay sober. I practiced principles that I learned in sobriety. I helped others with my beach fitness. I prayed. I meditated. But, I was still drifting off course. I was sober. But I didn’t feel safe like I felt in Bali. I didn’t feel community. I did feel like a productive member of society. I wasn’t existing above the levels of the basics. Food, Shelter, and Security. I was struggling with the basics.
              
              Walking in that new direction requires not only discipline but it requires an open mind. A mind open to considering any possibilities. A mind, spirit, and body that is willing to accept where I currently am but to continue to do the work to ascend to the highest spot on the pyramid, as Maslow opined.
              
              Self actualization-Desire to become the most that one can be.</p>
              <p>I felt myself reaching that energy level, in moments! But I wasn’t consistent. Something was missing. What do I do next? 
                The key was in the foundational work. Stay Ready for fifth step in this journey- #5 Get a mentor. 
                Seek others on the same path whose life has gotten better.</p>
